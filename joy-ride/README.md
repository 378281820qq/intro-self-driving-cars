# Joy Ride - Part 3: Parallel Parking

In this section you will write a function that implements the correct sequence of steps required to parallel park a vehicle.
Note for this segment the vehicle's maximum speed has been set to just over 4 mph. This should make parking a little easier.

## Submitting this Project!

Your parallel park function is *"correct"* when:
Your car doesn't hit any other cars.
Your car stops completely inside of the right lane.
Once you've got it working, it's time to submit. Submit by pressing the **SUBMIT** button at the lower right corner of this page.
