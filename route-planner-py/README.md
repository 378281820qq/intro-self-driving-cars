# Implementing a Route Planner

In this project you will use A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.

## Submission Checklist

1. Does my code pass all tests?
2. Does my code implement A* search and not some other search algorithm?
3. Do I use an admissible heuristic to direct search efforts towards the goal?
4. Do I use data structures which avoid unnecessarily slow lookups?
