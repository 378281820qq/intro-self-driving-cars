# Python to C++
1. Open the code in your favorite editor. You'll probably want to have the corresponding Python code around to consult as well.
2. Fill out the functions in localizer.cpp and helpers.cpp

**NOTE** - when compiling your code, make sure you use C++11. You can do this from the command line with the following:

``` cpp
g++ -std=c++11 tests.cpp
```

## Directory Structure

You should create a new project ***folder/directory*** to put the project code into. 
Inside that you should also create a 
***maps*** directory.
